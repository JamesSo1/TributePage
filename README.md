# Stephen Hillenburg Tribute Page

## Project Description

This project consists of a static webpage that looks to inform users on the life of Stephen Hillenburg (known for creating the hit children's TV show, _SpongeBob SquarePants_).

This project is responsive so that it may be presentable on all devices regardless of their screen width. This responsiveness was achieved through the use of media queries and the use of percentage values to specify the widths of certain elements.

## Credits

This project was created by just me. The outline/idea for this project came from the [freeCodeCamp responsive web design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).
